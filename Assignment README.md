# 09 Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator

## Summary

In this challenge, we'll create a README generator that is primairly powered by the (inquirer) node package.  The program is implemented in form of a CLI that when invoked prompts the user for a number of specific questions regarding the program features and then automatically creates a README.md file that is deposited in the same folder as the main program.

The CLI user prompts include the following:
1. Title of the project
2. Description of the project
3. List of industry standard Licenses to choose from
4. Installation guide
5. Usage guide
6. Contribution guide
7. Testing methods
8. Methods of contacting the author of the program to ask any questions

## Structure of the README
The README follows the following structure:
1. Title of project
2. The selected License badge along with a link to the website for the particular license is formatted and displayed near the top of the page
3. A clickable Table of Contents for reaching remaining sections is presented after the Description
4. Other sections correspondign to the CLI prompts outlined above are then formatted and displayed after the TOC
